    "### 1. Sourcing and Loading \n",
    "\n",
    "- Simple step\n",
    "- Consolidated web data source with good completeness and decent variable naming\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Cleaning, transforming, and visualizing\n",
    "**2.1. Exploring your data** \n",
    "\n",
    "- Some columns with naming out of the problem context (\"Unnamed\").\n",
    "     - Index column\n",
    "     - NaN values\n",
    "- Data table was transposed (wide)\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.2. Cleaning the data**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Table was transposed to a long table\n",
    "- Header adjusted (readability and maintenance)\n",
    "- Column of values converted to float (type adjustment)\n",
    "- Removal of NaN rows\n",
    "- Exclusion of 16 extra columns of regions not belonging to the desired borough output (32 columns).\n",
    "- Prior to exclusion those columns were validated\n",
    "    - Shifted header? No.\n",
    "    - Relevant data? No.\n",

    "- Delta histogram (20 years)\n",
    "\n",

    "### 4. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hackney Borough had the highest increase: 620% from 1998 to 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "- All top 15 had an increase above 500% and the difference among them is small.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Follow up\n",
    "\n",
    "* Find the years with the highest year-over-year variation.\n",
    "* 2008 Real Estate Crisis - impact\n",
    "    * Linear regression with data prior to 2008 - forecasted value to 2018 vs. realized. Did the market recover the \"momentum\"?\n",
    "* Top 3 growth vs. Bottom 3: similarities and differences? What is a common sense inside each cluster?"
